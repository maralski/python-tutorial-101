    "Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language."

    "* Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.\n",
    "* Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.\n",
    "* Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.\n",
    "* Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.\n",
    "* Python has Automatic Memory Management - No need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for variables and data arrays. No memory leak bugs. "

    "# Python Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's features include −\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Easy-to-learn__ − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Easy-to-read__ − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Easy-to-maintain__ − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __A broad standard library__ − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Interactive Mode__ − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Portable__ − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Extendable__ − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Databases__ − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __GUI Programming__ − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Scalable__ − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features, few are listed below −\n",
    "\n",
    "* It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It supports automatic garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java."
